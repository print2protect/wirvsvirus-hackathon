# print2protect and the #WirVsVirus Hackthon

The print2protect project was created during the [#WirVsVirus](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) hackathon from 20-22 march 2020.

From the very beginning there was great interest from people from various professional groups, so our main goal was to build up a common understanding of what print2protect should become. This is how the idea of print2protect came about. More information can be found on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/05_hilfsmittelverteilung_3d-druck-platform).

This repository serves as a collection of the output of all our hackathon materials and definitions. There will be own repository for the implementation later on.

## The idea

At the moment the idea is defined only in german speech in a [google docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15slopwhoA8_hV5Ji-oie93dJxsXuA-0LBNdZodec8Ck)
